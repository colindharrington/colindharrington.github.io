    <h1>Paletton</h1>
    <h2><a href="http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF" target="_blank">http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF</a></h2>

    <ul>
      <li>This is a website designed to help with color pairing</li>
      <li>The website has a color wheel and a display section where the colors are shown. The display section gives a few variations on the selected color tone.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I think this website has a very intuitive navigation. The websites main use is right on the front page, and you don't have to scroll or click through to get to the utility. </p>

    <h1>Met</h1>
    <h2><a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search#!?searchField=All&showOnly=openAccess&sortBy=relevance&offset=0&pageSize=0" target="_blank">https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search#!?searchField=All&showOnly=openAccess&sortBy=relevance&offset=0&pageSize=0</a></h2>
    <img src="met.jpg" width="500vmin"alt="Snapshot of this website">
    <ul>
      <li>This website hosts a large image collection of the various artworks owned of housed by the met.</li>
      <li>The interface makes sense, and does a good job of emphasizing the images and their ability to be arranged and examined.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This website has very appropriate navigation. The image resource is a catalogue, and most of the features on the website are there to display information or highlight images. </p>

    <h1>A third website</h1>
    <h2><a href="https://nobodyhere.com/nobodyhere/justme/" target="_blank">https://nobodyhere.com/nobodyhere/justme/</a></h2>
    <img src="nobodyhere.jpg" width="500vmin" alt="Snapshot of this website">
    <ul>
      <li>This website is an art project.</li>
      <li>On the "Why?" section of the page, the author explains "I like to express myself using animation, text and programming. The site has been on-line since 1998 and grew into hundreds of pages."</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The navigation for this page is very abstract. Given the contents of the website, this navigation is very effective because it draws you in and keeps you curiously exploring.</p>
