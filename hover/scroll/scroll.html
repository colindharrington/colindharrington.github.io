Being negative makes you miserable rather than protected from bad things happening.</h2></div>

        Now he has been reduced to a feeble condition, I am starting to understand I'm out there on my own, and even what he's sure of is suspect given his mental and physical facilities have been rapidly deteriorating in his late seventies. I feel horrible that I have noticed this long before he did - or at least admitted as much.</h2></div>

I don't know what the hell my problem was. Now I feel like, the universe is big, I don't know what all might be out there, I don't really care. I live as if there is no afterlife, because that makes sense to me. But if you don't, and you believe in one, that's perfectly fine, and maybe you're right. Who knows?</h2></div>

As I got older and lost religion I realized that abortion is absolutely necessary. Then I got pregnant and had a kid. It solidified things for me. No one should be forced to go through pregnancy and motherhood if they don't want to.</h2>

        Then, my husband became chronically ill, and the economy took a shit. My family has been close to homelessness more than once, and have relied on state insurance and assistance off and on throughout the past few years. There are definitely people out there who abuse the system, but some just get stuck in a horrible cycle of poverty.</h2></div>
